# Whitepaper: RTGS-Style AI Analyst CLI Tool

## Overview

Whitepaper is a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations and in-depth analysis of datasets, specifically designd for policymakers in government bodies. Inspired by tools like Gemini CLI and Anthropic Claude Code, this tool leverages AI agents to automate data preprocessing and provide actionable insights in Terminal through natural language interactions.

 Whitepaper enables users to navigate datasets, perform intelligent ETL tasks, and generate comprehensive analyses to support data-driven decision-making. The tool integrates multiple AI agents working collaboratively in the backend to ensure robust, accurate, and insightful results.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions about your datasets in plain English.
- **Automated ETL**: Intelligent detection and handling of missing values, data inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting issues.
- **Before/After Reporting**: Detailed reports on ETL changes with dataset overviews.
- **Deep Analysis**: Comprehensive statistical and contextual analysis for policy decisions.
- **Multi-Agent Backend**: Collaborative AI agents specializing in different aspects of data processing and analysis.
- **CLI-Based**: Easy installation and use via command line.
- **Dataset Agnostic**: Works with various data formats (CSV, JSON, Excel, etc.).

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis
- **AI/ML Framework**:
  - LangChain for orchestrating AI agents
  - OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude for natural language processing and analysis
- **CLI Framework**:  Typer 


## User Flow

1. **Installation**: Install the CLI tool via pip or from source.
2. **Navigation**: Navigate to your datasets folder using the terminal.
3. **Initialization**: Run the tool to initialize the AI analyst in the current directory.
4. **ETL Phase**:
   - The AI agent scans the datasets for issues (missing values, inconsistencies, etc.).
   - Performs automated cleaning and transformation.
   - Provides a detailed report of changes made, including before/after dataset summaries.
5. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Ask questions in natural language (e.g., "What are the trends in unemployment rates over the last decade?").
   - The AI generates comprehensive analyses, including statistics, visualizations, and policy recommendations.
6. **Interactive Session**: Continue asking follow-up questions for deeper insights.
7. **Export Results**: Save reports, visualizations, and summaries to files.
